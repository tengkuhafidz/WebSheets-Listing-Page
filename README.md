# SheetySite

This is a Gatsby template for creating a website based on Google sheets.

## Underlying Tech

- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- Sheets API

I have also configured the following setup and configurations, such as:

- SEO
- PWA and offline capabilities
- Site metadata
- eslint & prettier
- husky

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Run `yarn install` to download dependencies
2. To run in dev environment,

   - run `yarn start`
   - Your site will run at `http://localhost:8000`
   - You graphiql will run at`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`

3. To run in prod environment,
   - run `yarn build`
   - and then `yarn serve`
